# DEMUX_BCL2FQ
- Wrapping Illumina's bcl2fastq (version 2.20.0.422) execution commands with user supplied values.
- bcl2fastq's thread management is currently set to 10 read/write threads and a calculated value for processing threads
  - Currently (nproc -5)
- A submission script is used to format for submission to an HPC cluster
  - All resources will be reserved for the submission.
  - An email will be sent to the notifications alias when submission occurs and once the qsub process completes
- Execution must occur on one of the HPC submit nodes

# Command Line Arguments
- The submitter script currently accepts 2 command line arguments in the following order
  - The run folder name (e.g., 190114_A00527_0033_BH3WNYDRXX)
  - The full qualified linux format path to the sample sheet including the file name
    - /mnt/path/to/a/samplesheet.csv
  - The qsub command makes use of a flag (-l excl=true) that allows this submission to reserve all resources for a node of a queue
    -Currently when this job is viewed with a qstat command, the node will appear to have slots available though no other job will be allowed access.
